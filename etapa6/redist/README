A2I v0.4
by Pascal Lacroix

What is A2Iÿ?
-------------

	A2I converts assembly files in AT&T's syntax to files in Nasm's
syntax. This means that you can mix 16 and 32 bits code with GCC and Nasm.
You can also produce object files in other format than COFF because
Nasm supports many. A2I should be useful in OS developping.

Here is an example:

; example for a .com file :

[section .text]
[BITS 16]
[org 0x100]

startup:
	mov ax, cs
	mov ds, ax
	mov es, ax
	...
	mov eax, cr0
	inc eax
	mov cr0, eax
; now in pmode !
	jmp KERNEL_CS:startup32

[BITS 32]
startup32:
	mov ax, KERNEL_DS
	mov ds, ax
	mov es, ax
	...
	call  _main

	jmp exit_to_dos
	
%include "main.asm"

; end of file.

And you must also have a file named "main.c" with a function main, which
will be converted by A2I into "main.asm".

How to build ?
--------------
        Just type `make'. All should work :)
        (you'll need GNU make, bison and gcc)
        
How to use itÿ?
---------------

        To convert a file, simply type: "a2i filename.s". A2I will convert
it to "filename.asm".

There are some switches which could be useful:

-o name.asm     will set the output filename to "nasm.asm"

-B baseaddr	will set the base address of your program. This option is
                experimental. For more information, see in the EXAMPLE
                directory.

-O1             will align all symbols in .data or .bss section to 4, and
                all symbols in .text to 2 (with nops)

-O2             will align all symbols to 4 (all sections).

--no-info	will suppress unneeded information (debug info and
                gcc_compiled labels).
